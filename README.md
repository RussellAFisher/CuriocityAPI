# Curiocity API

A RESTful API designed to receive the GPS coordinates from my Curiocity native app and in turn hit Google and Zillow APIs for pertinent information.

This was created as a means of reducing bandwidth usage by my Curiocity app, collecting information and compiling it into one results package.
